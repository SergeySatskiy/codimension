This directory contains implementation of the Python parser used
in Codimension.

The parser library requires ../thirdparty/libantlr3c-3.2 to be
built in place.  This version of the ANTLR library is patched and
differs from the original release.  The stock binary of the same
version won't work.

It is important that libantlr is configured with the following
options:

* --with-pic
* --enable-64bit (for the 64-bit Python runtime)
